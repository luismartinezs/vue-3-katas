# Vue 3 composition API katas

Just something to help me (and you) learn the composition API

Plans:

- [x] Url structure: /kata-slug/instructions, /kata-slug/start, /kata-slug/finish
- [ ] Dynamically import entry vue component from katas, somehow (config file?)
- [ ] Able to use markdown as input
- [ ] User login
- [ ] Integrated IDE
- [ ] Leveling system
- [ ] Responsive layout
